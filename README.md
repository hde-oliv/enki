## Brief Introduction:

This is my project for the 42 Labs challenge of making an API entirely in C, it wasn't easy, but, here it is.  
You can read my post of thoughts about it on my blog: https://hde-oliv.github.io/p/rest-in-c/

## More information:
You can see more information in the [wiki](https://github.com/hde-oliv/enki/wiki) of this project. It also contains the original readme and the page explaining how to host it!  
This repository has few commits because I didn't want to bring the old history (lots of security flaws). :)
